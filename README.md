# SpigotDefaultDance
I was shocked there was no Minecraft Spigot plugin to make your character do the Fortnite Default Dance, so I had to correct this issue.
I made this plugin in like 4 hours (Excluding me being terrible at math) so don't expect too much.

## Usage
`/defaultdance`, that's it.  
You can either run the command again or crouch to stop dancing when it is still active.  

## Permissions
`defaultdance.use` - Allow using `/defaultdance`.  

## Installation
Get the Jar from GitHub releases or compile from source, then place it in your plugins directory.
